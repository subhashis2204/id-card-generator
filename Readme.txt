This is an automatic id card generator. If you are 
copying the code then make sure that you have an 
image directory in the folder where the code is 
copied. This code takes an image from the image 
folder and then it will ask for the details in the
prompt of that user though you may not be able to 
see the image. It will generate as many id cards as 
the number of images in the image directory. The code 
will automatically create a folder in which the 
resized images of the image are present plus a folder
in which the id cards are present. There will a qr 
code embedded in the card which will contain the 
information of the person.

any suggested improvement in the code is welcomed.
