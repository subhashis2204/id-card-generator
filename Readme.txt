This is an automatic id card generator. If you are 
copying the code then make sure that you have an 
image directory in the folder where the code is 
copied. This code takes an image from the image 
folder and then it will ask for the details of that person 
in the prompt. You should enter the details of the person as they
are lined up in the image folder.It will generate as many id cards
as the number of images in the image directory. The code 
will automatically create a folder in which the 
resized images are present plus a folder
in which the id cards are present. There will be a QR 
code embedded in the card which will contain the 
information of the person.

any suggested improvement in the code is welcomed.
